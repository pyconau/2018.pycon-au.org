An unprecedented 68.5 million people around the world have been forced from their homes.  

In a world where nearly 1 person is forcibly displaced every 2 seconds as a result of conflict or persecution, programs that support the plight of refugees around the world have never been more important.

Techfugees is a global movement created by leaders from the startup technology community as our contribution towards helping these refugees.

Since founding the Techfugees Australia chapter in late 2015, Annie and the team have run a series of meetups, hackathons and technical workshops for newly arrived migrants and refugees to help integrate them into their new lives here in Australia.  

The approach the Techfugees Australia team have taken to co-design tech solutions is unique, the collaborative approach they have built together with the refugee community and local NGO’s has been something that has been replicated all over the world.  

Annie will be sharing with us some of her top tips on how we can all support this community going forward, and of course sharing some of the amazing success stories they’ve had along the way too.

By the end of this session, Annie hopes to have reminded you just how much good we can all do with our technical skills, and perhaps have inspired you to want to get involved too.
