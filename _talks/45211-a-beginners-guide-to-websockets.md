abstract: A gentle introduction to the web-socket protocol, how it works, it's intended
  usage and a number of examples where it can be used with Python and it's popular
  web frameworks - topped off with a rapid demonstration of the speed and ease of
  which it can be implemented with Python.

Many projects on the web fundamentally require full-duplex communication channels between a server and client which basic TCP protocols do not provide; the WebSockets protocol provides a foundation for such two-way communications to exist efficiently and with little configuration - an instrumental outlet for building applications for real time data on the web.

This talk will cover the basics of HTTP and WebSockets under the hood, how the protocol works, the intended usage of the protocol, it's speed and a variety of examples of it's implementation on Python and it's popular web frameworks - topped off with a rapid demonstration of the speed and ease of which it can be implemented to create a real-time application with Python.
