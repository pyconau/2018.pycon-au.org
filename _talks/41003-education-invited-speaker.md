title: Data is the new shiny thing
endTime: "10:00"

abstract: |
  Data Science is the tag of choice for grant applications, project proposals,
  and media opportunities. It’s the latest shiny buzz word toy. But it turns
  out that data science is crucial to our lives and the future of the planet.
  It’s also a fun, easy, and motivating way to teach kids programming and give
  them the chance to make a real difference in the world. So let’s talk about
  using Python and real datasets to take over the world, and, incidentally,
  teach STEM.

      bio: | 
        Dr Linda McIver started out as an Academic with a PhD in Computer Science Education. When it became apparent that High School teaching was a lot more fun, Linda began a highly successful career at John Monash Science School, where she built innovative courses in Computational and Data Science for year 10 and year 11 students.
        Nominated one of the inaugural Superstars of STEM in 2017, Linda is passionate about creating authentic project experiences to motivate all students to become technologically and data literate.
        While Linda loves the classroom, it was rapidly becoming clear that teachers in the Australian School system were keen to embrace Data Science, but that there was a serious lack of resources to support that. That’s why Linda created ADSEI – to support Data Science in education.
