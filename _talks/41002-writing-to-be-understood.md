abstract: | 
  As developers, we write a lot more than just code. We write commit messages; we
  review our colleagues’ code; we email collaborators; we tweet our hottest
  takes. 

  Good written communication can make your systems easier to use and maintain,
  encourage your colleagues to be more receptive to your suggestions, and make
  you more popular on the internet. I’ll share some practical ways to communicate
  more effectively, and some less practical theory about how people and language
  work.

This talk is about helping developers to communicate effectively with writing, focused on the type of writing that we use to communicate with colleagues and collaborators, like commit messages, Slack messages, emails, and code reviews.


We’ll do a review of the types of communication that we tend to write on a day-to-day basis, and will use those as examples to illustrate techniques and strategies to write more effectively. I’ll use some ideas from discourse theory and draw some parallels between good writing and good code.
