Did you know the role women and nonbinary people have played in building the Python community worldwide? Our speaker interviewed both established and emerging leaders in the Python community, and will share their insights on what is most exciting in Python in 2018. This is an opportunity to hear insights from other community members, and to acknowledge their contributions.

Our speaker is documenting the contributions of women and under-represented people in the Python community, and continuously updating this talk as new people and interviews are added to the slides.
