Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and two-factor auth (2FA) are becoming popular, but how do they work? What are the options, how secure are they, and how do you use them in your own applications?

We'll answer all these and more, covering everything from Django integration to cryptography.

We will cover:

* Authentication apps, like Google Authenticator, Authy, Duo
* SMS-based authentication
* Hardware tokens, like the Yubikey
* Biometrics
* Problems with MFA
* Cryptography behind some of these algorithms
* New developments like U2F, TPMs, secure chips
