title: PyCon AU over for another year
---

Well, that's it for 2018. 

Over the last 5 days, 713 Pythonistas from across the globe joined us for 90 sessions of talks by 113 speakers. 39 attendees were able to get to the conference with help of financial assistance, 400% more high school students present talks since last year, a 16-person-strong AV team was able to get 80 talks uploaded on YouTube before the conference close, with a shortest time to YouTube of 1h 15m ([Watch the Videos from PyCon AU 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs4CJRBY5F1KrUr7z_2mur2QdAKXyh-k3))
