Ready, set, write!

Our PyCon Australia 2018 Call for Presentations (CFP) will be open from Monday, April 23 Anywhere On Earth (AoE) to Monday, May 28 AoE.

We welcome submissions from everybody, including those:
* who have never given a conference talk before,
* who are new to Python,
* who have built interesting things in Python, 
* who have helped build Python, and
* who have expertise to share with our community from fields outside of Python (and outside of technology).

If you've never presented at a conference before and think you might like to try it, we want to hear from you! The program committee is very much interested in encouraging and supporting new speakers, and we will have speaking mentors on hand to work with you to develop your proposal and talk content so you can give the best talk possible.

Our CFP process also encompasses submissions to the four Specialist Tracks (Education, Internet of Things, Security and Privacy, and DjangoCon Australia), so you can submit your talk to the main conference and the Specialist Tracks with one click.

Please [go to our Speak page](https://2018.pycon-au.org/speak) for more details on how to submit a proposal for PyCon AU 2018.

Some financial aid will be available for PyCon AU speakers. For more information on our Financial Aid policy and how to apply, please see our [Financial Assistance](https://2018.pycon-au.org/assistance/) page.

If you have questions about the CFP process, or want to ask one of our PyCon AU mentors for advice on your talk idea, you can reach us at [program@pycon-au.org](mailto:program@pycon-au.org).

And please help us spread the word about our CFP by sharing a link to this page or using the hashtag #pyconau.
