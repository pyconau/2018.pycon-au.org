## Important Information

PyCon AU 2018 will be held in Sydney, Australia, at the [International Convention Center, Sydney](www.iccsydney.com.au)

- August 24: Specialist Tracks
- August 25-26: Conference Main Track 
- August 27-28: Development Sprints

## Specialist Tracks

The first day of PyCon AU is dedicated to specialist tracks. These tracks, also known as 'mini-confs', are curated
by smaller specialist groups within Python community, and allow for more in-depth talks on the subject. 

In previous years, specialist have included [Django](https://djangocon.com.au), Science and Data, Python in Education and Internet of Things. 

The set of Specialist Events is determined by a seperate Call for Specialist Tracks in late 2017, with the talks proposals for the tracks submitted in the main Call For Proposals in mid 2018.

## Conference Main Track

The weekend of PyCon AU, traditionally the Saturday and Sunday, is the main conference event. We invite speakers from all backgrounds and levels of knowledge to share their experience and knowledge with our audience. 

The talks do not have to be about Python, but should be interesting for a Python-loving audience. 

Full details on the talk selection process will be available in our Call for Proposals. 

## Development Sprints

Following three days of talks, we hold space in our venue for two days of Development Sprints (sometimes shortened just to 'Sprints')

Since you've travelled all the way to Sydney for a Python event, why not stay an extra day or two and stretch your legs in the new things you've learnt, or dive into some interesting projects you've heard about over the weekend?

Development Sprints provide an unstructured location for projects and contributors to work in real time on their projects, or for people to hack about with various things with people with experts in their fields. 

The sprints are normally uncatered, but the conference will provide copious amounts of table space, power, and internet connectivity.
