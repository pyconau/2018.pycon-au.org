## Essential Information

The 2018 PyCon Australia Python in Education Seminar will be held on Friday
August 24th in Sydney, Australia, at the
[International Convention Center, Sydney](https://www.iccsydney.com.au).

## Seminar Overview

Python is both a simple and consistent language for beginners and a powerful
real-world language used in industry.
This combination is why it's a popular language in education: it's a great way
to start for beginner programmers who are beyond graphical programming environments
like Scratch and reaching the limitations of 'toy' languages.

The Python in Education seminar aims to bring together Python educators to share
ideas and resources. Come along to hear how Python is used to teach programming
in school classrooms and extracurricular clubs and camps around Australia.
This is a time to share resources and experiences and to bring up any setbacks
to a group of people keen and ready to help out.

If you're new to Python, this is a great opportunity to see what it can do, how
it works in an educational environment and build up your own skills and confidence.

## Format

The Python in Education Seminar runs each year at the start of PyCon Australia, in
parallel with a number of other specialist events. In 2018, the Python in Education
Seminar will take place on Friday the 24th of August.

For the morning and post-lunch sessions, the talk schedule will be aligned with
the other PyCon specialist tracks that are running simultaneously to make it
easy for attendees that choose to do so to attend parts of each of them.

For the first time in 2018, the post-afternoon-tea session at the Education
Seminar will feature a dedicated Student Showcase, an opportunity for students
in Years 7-12 to give short presentations regarding projects they have been
working on in Python, including ways in which Python has helped (and perhaps
hindered!) their efforts.

## Audience

All are welcome to attend the Python in Education Seminar! If you're submitting
a proposal, the kind of audience to expect includes:

- Primary and secondary school teachers
- Tertiary educators teaching beginner-level courses
- Organisers and volunteers at coding clubs or camps
- Creators of educational software and teaching materials
- Parents keen to teach their children to code
- Professional and hobbyist software developers interested in education

Those curious as to what this seminar is about may also want to take a look at

We will accept a wide range of talks, and are happy to consider
proposals for hands-on activities, live demonstrations, or led discussions.

## Submitting a project presentation for the Student Showcase

If you're a student eager to submit a presentation about a project you're working

## Community Partners

The PyCon Australia Python in Education Seminar happens but once a year, while
students, teachers, and community volunteers need support and resources
throughout the year. As such, the organisers of the Python in Education
Seminar are delighted to have the following organisations involved as
community partners.

### Australian Computing Academy

Lead by the University of Sydney, the
[Australian Computing Academy](https://aca.edu.au/about.html) provides training,
resources, and support to Australian educators in implementing the Australian
Digital Technologies Curriculum.

With funding from the Australian Government Department of Education and Training,
ACA also offer the Australian Digital Technologies Challenges for Years 5 - 8.

### Code Club Australia

[Code Club Australia](https://codeclubau.org/About-Us) was founded in 2014 and
expanded thanks to funding from the Telstra Foundation. It aims to provide free
resources, training and events to communities all over Australia, with Code Club
volunteers serving over 75,000 youth a week.

If you're interested in helping folks learn to code outside a formal educational
setting, Code Club offers plenty of opportunities to
[volunteer](https://codeclubau.org/get-involved).
