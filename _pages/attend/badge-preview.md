### Badge Preview

When you register for PyCon AU, you'll be using Tito. You'll have three fields to enter: 
 * First Name
 * Last Name
 * Company Name

We will use these three fields to make your badge. 

Want to know what your badge will look like on the day? We've created a dynamic template to show you an *approximation* of what you'll get on the day.

You are free to use the *Company* field as you like, so long as the content doesn't violate our [code of conduct](/conduct) 

Please use this to test the length of the content you want to add, especially the "Company" field. 

<hr>
*Changing the fields in the following form will live-update the badge below. Requires JavaScript*

{% include badge-template.html %}

*This render is an approximation and is subject to change*
