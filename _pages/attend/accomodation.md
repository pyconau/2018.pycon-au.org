### Accomodation

{% include accomodation.html %}

Accommodation is not included in conference registration. We strongly encourage attendees to organise their accommodation as early as possible. Sydney is a busy place with a lot going on.

We are located right in Cockle Bay/Darling Harbour/Pyrmont, so while there are hotels right on the same block as the venue, you can go as far afield as the CBD and still be within a 10 minute walk of venue. 

Sydney also has AirBnB, hostels, and backpackers, for cheaper accomodation options.
