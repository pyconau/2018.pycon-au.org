### Ticket Tiers

There's a lot of information here, so if you are unfamiliar with how we do at PyCon AU, read carefully. 

We want everyone to be able to attend our conference, regardless of financial ability. 

In addition to our [financial assistance](/assistance), we offer tiers of tickets for people who can afford to pay more, or need to pay less.

#### Contributor ✨

The Contributor ticket is designed for those who wish to attend PyCon AU 2018 as a Professional delegate, as well as supporting the conference by contributing financially.

#### Professional

The Professional ticket is our all-access pass to the conference. This rate applies to most people who have their companies pay the conference fees, or for individuals who can otherwise afford to support the conference at this level.

#### Enthusiast

The Enthusiast rate is heavily discounted for Python enthusiasts who are paying out of their own pockets and would otherwise find it difficult to attend.

This tier comes in two versions: Sat/Sun, or Fri/Sat/Sun. You can choose between just the Saturday and Sunday, or make a long-weekend of PyCon AU and come for the Friday as well as the Saturday and Sunday.

#### Student

This concession rate is reserved for College (TAFE, Polytechnic, Senior Secondary, etc) or University Students. PyCon Australia offers this rate as a form of investment in the future of the Python programming community. As part of the registration process, a valid student ID card or proof of enrolment must be presented to the onsite registration desk. Any Student who cannot provide this will be required to register at PyCon Australia as an enthusiast by paying the difference in fees between the Student rate and the Enthusiast rate. This rate does not include a shirt.

#### Specialist Track Day (Friday Only)

As much as we'd like to see you for the entire event, there is an option if you can only attend one of our Specialist Track days. This does not include access to the weekend of the event, and does not include a shirt. 


#### Development Sprint Addons

Don't forget to plan ahead for the Development Sprints. Are you going to be
sticking around after the weekend? Come back to the venue and join other
conference attendees, full of fresh ideas, and develop on your favourite pet
project, or discover something new to participate in.

These tickets are **additional** to the main weekend tickets, and space is limited. 

#### Extra Shirts

If your tier doesn't come with a shirt, or you want an extra, these are available separately.
