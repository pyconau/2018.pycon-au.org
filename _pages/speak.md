## <a name="basic-information"></a> Basic information

We want you [to present at PyCon AU](https://www.papercall.io/pyconau2018)!

Tell us about what you've been hacking on, what drives you, what excites you. What have you been learning? What do you want to share?

**The 2018 Call for Presentations (CFP) is open from Monday, April 23 [Anywhere On Earth (AoE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth) to Monday, May 28 AoE.**

Do you have a talk for the main conference track, or something more specialised for our Friday specialist tracks? [Submit now!](https://www.papercall.io/pyconau2018)

If you've never presented at a conference before and think you might like to try it, [submit now!](https://www.papercall.io/pyconau2018)

We're looking for 30 minute talks on everything Python, open source, and tech-related.

We welcome submissions from everybody, including those:

* who have never given a conference talk before,
* who are new to Python,
* who have built interesting things in Python,
* who have broken interesting things with Python,
* who have helped build Python, and
* who have expertise to share with our community from fields outside of Python (and outside of technology).

Thinking of something cool? We want to hear from you!

You can submit a proposal for the main conference, and all of our four Specialist Tracks, [through PaperCall](https://www.papercall.io/pyconau2018) or reach us any time with questions at **[program@pycon-au.org](mailto:program@pycon-au.org)**.

Have a read of our [anonymity FAQ and review process guidelines](/cfp-guidelines/#anonymity-guidelines) before you start.

## <a name="specialist-tracks"></a> Specialist Tracks

The first day of PyCon AU is dedicated to specialist tracks. These tracks are curated by smaller specialist groups within Python community, and allow for more in-depth talks on the subject.

In 2018, these tracks will be: [DjangoCon, Security and Privacy, Education, and Internet of Things.](http://2018.pycon-au.org/news/specialist-tracks).

You can submit to any or all of these Specialist Tracks [through PaperCall](https://www.papercall.io/pyconau2018).

This year's Education Seminar will feature a Student Showcase in the post afternoon tea session, with presentations specifically from students in Years 7-12. Applications for that are taken separately: see the [Student Showcase submission page](/speak/showcase) for details!

## <a name="mentors"></a> Mentors

In order to support speakers, we offer mentorship and feedback to those who would like it.

A mentor is an experienced presenter who has volunteered to help other presenters. For first-time presenters, non-native English speakers, under-confident or uncertain speakers, or anyone who would just appreciate another set of eyes, our mentors are here to help. You’ll get the best results by forming a relationship with one mentor, rather than contacting several.

Our mentors are happy to help with any of the following:

* Exploring and brainstorming your interests to help you identify hidden things that would make great talks
* Connecting you with experienced speakers to help build your proposal and talk
* Reviewing your outline, slide deck, or presenter notes
* Connecting you with rehearsal audiences or even just watching you present over a video conference as practice
* Anything else that'd help you be at ease and excited about bringing your ideas to our audience!

If you would like some help from a mentor, you can reach out to them directly:

* Lilly Ryan (mentoring at attacus.net): experienced international speaker, PyCon AU 2018 Papers Chair, security engineer, and former historian.
* Richard Jones (r1chardj0n3s at gmail.com): Python Software Foundation Fellow, former PyCon AU organiser, speaker, and engineer.
* Jack Skinner (opensource at developerjack.com): experienced international speaker, PyCon AU 2018 organiser, developer evangelist, and winner of the DjangoCon AU 2017 Bright Pink Hoodie Auction.

*Each mentor's email has been split up to prevent automated crawling. Please do not abuse the ability to directly contact our mentors.*

## <a name="how-to-write-your-proposal"></a> How to write your proposal

[Make sure to check out our anonymity FAQ before you submit.](/cfp-guidelines/)

If you have an idea (or don't!) and want to speak, here's a very rough process of what you should do next:

* Brainstorm or mind map to expand upon your ideas or knowledge in search of a general topic
* Write a paragraph or two, or some bullet points, to outline the core concepts you want to communicate and what people might learn from your talk
* Get someone you trust to read your notes and tell you what they think they'd learn
* Ask one of our mentors for help with building up your submission
* Practice!

This [public speaking repository](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/Public_Speaking), maintained by [VM Brasseur](https://twitter.com/vmbrasseur), has many useful resources to help you polish your proposals and talks.

## <a name="conduct-and-expectations"></a> Conduct and expectations

All speakers will be expected to have read and adhere to the conference [Code of Conduct](http://2018.pycon-au.org/conduct/). In particular for speakers: slide contents and spoken material should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate, and neither are language or imagery that denigrate or demean people based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, or body size.

## <a name="anonymity"></a> Anonymity

Our submission process is anonymous. This means our reviewers will not know anything about your identity while assessing your proposal.

Please avoid including identifying information like your name or your pronouns (he/she/they) anywhere in your proposal so that our reviewers can assess your talk by itself.

Make sure to read our [anonymity FAQ](/cfp-guidelines/) before your final submission! This FAQ contains important tips on what "anonymous" looks like, and provides information on our review process.

**PLEASE NOTE:** If your proposal still contains identifying information by the time the CFP closes on Monday, May 28 [Anywhere on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth), ***it will be disqualified from consideration for PyCon AU 2018***. This is because, if this information is included, we cannot guarantee that your talk will have been reviewed without bias. Read our [anonymity FAQ](/cfp-guidelines/) for more information.

Emails sent to [program@pycon-au.org](mailto:program@pycon-au.org) will only be seen by people on the organising team who do not have the ability to rate and review talks.

## <a name="speaker-benefits"></a> Speaker benefits

Proposals which are accepted will receive one free ticket to PyCon Australia 2018. You are welcome to propose a talk with more than one speaker, but please be aware that if it is accepted, only one complimentary ticket will be allocated.

## <a name="financial-support"></a> Financial support

Don't let finances stop you from submitting a talk proposal. Speakers receive free conference tickets and there is further financial assistance available based on need. See the [financial assistance page](/assistance/) for more details about the selection process and a link to the application form.

## <a name="questions"></a> Have a question? Unsure about anything?

If you have questions about the CFP process, you can reach us any time at **[program@pycon-au.org](mailto:program@pycon-au.org)**.
